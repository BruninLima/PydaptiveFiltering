> Python 3.? package of adaptive filtering functions based on the book Adaptive Filtering - Algorithms and Pratical Implementation, Paulo Diniz. Also, based on the MATLAB Adaptive Filtering Toolbox.  

### Future Work

The project is currently on its early stages (pre-alpha). The planned order of work is the following:

- [x] LMS based algorithms
- [x] LMS Examples + Notebooks
- [x] RLS based algorithms
- [ ] RLS Examples + Notebooks
- [ ] SetMembership Algorithms
- [ ] Lattice-based RLS
