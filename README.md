> A modern Python package of adaptive filtering functions based on the book Adaptive Filtering - Algorithms and Pratical Implementation, Paulo Diniz. Also, based on the MATLAB Adaptive Filtering Toolbox.  

### Future Work

The project is currently on its early stages (pre-alpha). The planned order of work for every kind of algorithm is: (Algorithm(1), Examples(2), Notebooks(3)). The following is the planned and current progress for each of the algorithms:

- [x] LMS based algorithms
- [x] RLS based algorithms
- [x] SetMembership Algorithms
- [ ] Lattice-based RLS (0/3)
- [ ] Fast Transversal RLS (0/2)
- [x] QR
- [ ] IIR Filters (0/5)
- [ ] Nonlinear Filters (1/6)
- [ ] Subband Filters (0/3)
- [x] BlindFilters

## üíª Requirements

* Currently it requires Python 3.5 or later. 

## üöÄ Install Instructions

To install the package with pip:
```
