### Future Work

The project is currently on its early stages (pre-alpha). The planned order of work is the following:

- [x] LMS based algorithms
- [x] LMS Examples + Notebooks
- [x] RLS based algorithms
- [ ] RLS Examples + Notebooks
- [ ] SetMembership Algorithms
- [ ] Lattice-based RLS

## üíª Requirements

* Currently it requires Python 3.5 or later.
